    "text": "Proposed Learning Outcomes\nThe overall goal of this course is to provide students with the foundations necessary for understanding and building on their existing skillset with emphasis on the clear and effective visual communication of data. After this quarter, students will have:\n\nAn understanding of different ways to visually represent data (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, heat maps), and when and how to use them effectively to represent different kinds of data and relationships,\nAn understanding of how to explore and analyze data to discover patterns, trends, insights and then to communicate these to a larger audience,\nAn understanding of data models: ways of structuring, organizing and transforming different types of data (quantitative, qualitative, spatial) for effective visualization,\nAn understanding of graphical perception/perceived visual information. Applying some of the cognitive principles related to visual perception and to create compelling visualizations,\nThe ability to use data visualization tools and supporting software, for example open-source libraries in Python (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) and R (e.g., ggplot2) with , Quarto, and others,\nDesigning and creating interactive data visualizations that allow users to explore data at their own pace, using tools such as Streamlit (Python) or Shiny (R),\nProducing a brief thesis-styled report with visualizations applied in a student’s personal domains of interest such as business, entertainment, healthcare, public policy, and encouraging novel combinations of these (e.g., business + law + data)."

    "text": "Academic Dishonesty\nAs Bruins, we uphold the UCLA Student Code of Conduct. Academic dishonesty means activities like plagiarism, unauthorized material used on exams, unauthorized collaborations etc. According to Senate Regulation A-306, if an instructor encounters a problem, the instructor must report it to the Dean of Students. Sources: https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Student-Conduct#10690514-student-conduct-code, https://ucla.app.box.com/s/8xq1jyrvqhs9343e4rzyvporx9lt8u1g\nAI Assistant policy\nYour instructor’s belief is AI such as Claude, ChatGPT, etc. should be used – wisely – as if it were an amazingly clever tutor or friend. But copying and pasting the code of the first example’s (below) ChatGPT response is not about learning and chances are, you will forget how to do it if you do not do it regularly. Asking ChatGPT questions in the second way gives your mind the opportunity to develop the skills scaffolding and retain the knowledge long after this course is over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nResponse\n\n\n\nPlease write some code in R that splits a dataset into test and training.\ninstall.packages(“caret”) # Run only if not already installed\n\n\n\nlibrary(caret)\n\n\n\nset.seed(123)\n\n\n\ntrain_indices &lt;- createDataPartition(mtcars$mpg, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)\n\n\n\ntrain_data &lt;- mtcars[train_indices, ]\n\n\n\ntest_data &lt;- mtcars[-train_indices, ]\n\n\n\nLet me know if you’d like to stratify the split (e.g., ensure balance on a categorical variable) or save the result to file.\n\n\nPlease teach me on how to write code using base R that splits a dataset into training and test with a 70-30 split - but don’t write the code for me, I want to learn how to think it through on my own.\nAbsolutely, I’d be glad to guide you on how to approach this! 1. Understanding the Data: - Before you begin, familiarize yourself with the dataset. Use functions like str(), head(), and summary() to understand the structure and contents of your data. 2. Setting a Seed: - To ensure that your results are reproducible, you will want to set a seed using the set.seed() function. This function controls the random number generator in R. 3. Determining the Number of Rows: - You need to know the total number of rows in your dataset to create the splits. The nrow() function can help you determine this.\n\n\n\n4. Calculating Split Sizes: - Next, determine how many rows should go into your training and test sets. You’ll want 70% of the data to be in the training set and 30% in the test set. Use arithmetic operations to calculate the respective sizes.\n\n\n\n5. Creating a Random Sample of Indices: - To create your training set, you’ll need to randomly select 70% of the indices (row numbers) from your dataset. You can use the sample() function to do this. Remember to use the total number of rows and the size of the training set as parameters in this function.\n\n\n\n6. Subsetting the Dataset: - Once you have a vector of random indices, use it to subset your dataset into two parts: one for training and one for testing. In R, you can subset a data frame using square brackets []. You’ll use the vector of random indices to select rows for the training set, and the - operator to select the remaining rows for the test set.\n\n\n\n7. Verifying Your Split: - After creating your training and test sets, verify that you’ve split the data correctly. Use the dim() function to check the dimensions of each set and ensure the split ratio is approximately 70-30. You can also use the head() function to quickly view the top rows of each set and ensure they look correct.  Remember to write your code step by step, verifying each part before moving on to the next, to avoid confusion and ensure accuracy. Once you are confident in your understanding of each step, try to write the code on your own. Good luck!\n\n\n\nAI assistants are wonderful tools to help you with subjects that are outside of your skill set which do not make sense for you to invest huge amounts of time or resources remembering/learning."
