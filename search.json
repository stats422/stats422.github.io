After this quarter, students will have:\n\nAn Understanding of different ways to visually represent data and familiarity with various types of charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, heat maps), and when and how to use them effectively to represent different kinds of data and relationships.\nAn understanding of data models: ways of structuring and organizing data for effective visualization. Understanding different types of data (quantitative, qualitative, spatial) and transformation and visual representation.\nAn understanding of Graphical Perception/perceived visual information. Some of the cognitive principles related to visual perception and using these principles to create compelling visualizations.\nGenerated interactive visualizations"

    "section": "Academic Dishonesty",
    "text": "Academic Dishonesty\nAs Bruins, we uphold the UCLA Student Code of Conduct. Academic dishonesty means activities like plagiarism, unauthorized material used on exams, unauthorized collaborations etc. According to Senate Regulation A-306, if an instructor encounters a problem, the instructor must report it to the Dean of Students.\n\nhttps://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Student-Conduct#10690514-student-conduct-code\nhttps://ucla.app.box.com/s/8xq1jyrvqhs9343e4rzyvporx9lt8u1g\n\n\nChatGPT policy\nYour instructor’s belief is ChatGPT should be used – wisely – as if it were an amazingly clever tutor or friend. But copying and pasting the code of the first example’s (below) ChatGPT response is not learning and chances are, you won’t remember how to do it if you do not do it regularly. Asking ChatGPT questions in the second way gives your mind the opportunity to develop the skills scaffolding and retain the knowledge long after this course is over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nResponse\n\n\n\n\nPlease write some code in R that splits a dataset into test and training.\nTo split a dataset into training and test sets in R, you commonly use a function like createDataPartition from the caret package:  Using the caret package  First, install and load the caret package if you haven’t already:  install.packages(“caret”)  library(caret)  Next, use the createDataPartition function to create a list of indices for the training set, then use these indices to create the training and test sets:  # Load the necessary package library(caret) # Load or import your dataset (replace ‘your_dataset’ with your actual dataset)  # data &lt;- read.csv(“path/to/your/dataset.csv”)  # Create the data partition  set.seed(123) # Set seed for reproducibility  trainIndex &lt;- createDataPartition(data$your_target_variable, p = .8, list = FALSE, times = 1)  # Create training and test datasets trainData &lt;- data[ trainIndex,] testData &lt;- data[-trainIndex,] Replace your_target_variable with the name of the column that contains the target variable you’re interested in, and replace data with your dataset name.\n\n\nPlease teach me on how to write code using base R that splits a dataset into training and test with a 70-30 split - but don’t write the code for me, I want to learn how to think it through on my own.\nAbsolutely, I’d be glad to guide you on how to approach this!   1. Understanding the Data: - Before you begin, familiarize yourself with the dataset. Use functions like str(), head(), and summary() to understand the structure and contents of your data.  2. Setting a Seed: - To ensure that your results are reproducible, you will want to set a seed using the set.seed() function. This function controls the random number generator in R.  3. Determining the Number of Rows: - You need to know the total number of rows in your dataset to create the splits. The nrow() function can help you determine this.  4. Calculating Split Sizes: - Next, determine how many rows should go into your training and test sets. You’ll want 70% of the data to be in the training set and 30% in the test set. Use arithmetic operations to calculate the respective sizes.  5. Creating a Random Sample of Indices: - To create your training set, you’ll need to randomly select 70% of the indices (row numbers) from your dataset. You can use the sample() function to do this. Remember to use the total number of rows and the size of the training set as parameters in this function.  6. Subsetting the Dataset: - Once you have a vector of random indices, use it to subset your dataset into two parts: one for training and one for testing. In R, you can subset a data frame using square brackets []. You’ll use the vector of random indices to select rows for the training set, and the - operator to select the remaining rows for the test set.  7. Verifying Your Split: - After creating your training and test sets, verify that you’ve split the data correctly. Use the dim() function to check the dimensions of each set and ensure the split ratio is approximately 70-30. You can also use the head() function to quickly view the top rows of each set and ensure they look correct.   Remember to write your code step by step, verifying each part before moving on to the next, to avoid confusion and ensure accuracy. Once you are confident in your understanding of each step, try to write the code on your own. Good luck!\n\n\n\nChatGPT is also a wonderful tool to help you with subjects that are outside of your skill set which do not make sense for you to invest huge amounts of time or resources remembering/learning."
