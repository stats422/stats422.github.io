Both X and Y here are numeric in all of these examples but ordered factors should work (so if you want to use something like a sports-related dataset with teamnames etc. it’s do-able).\nYou can use the data I used (least preferred) or supply your own from your thesis or other interests (most preferred) OR use something like diamonds, iris, etc. (somewhere in the middle)\nA trick is to use scale_fill_gradientn() to build your own colors scheme. I will show you the basic code for these and then what you should do for homework is modify it some way that makes it more pleasing to you (something you might want in your thesis for example).\nmovies\n\nmovies &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewv/S24STATS101A/main/data/movies.csv\")\n\nRows: 7551 Columns: 15\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (9): name, rating, genre, released, director, writer, star, country, com...\ndbl (6): year, score, votes, budget, gross, runtime\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nA basic geom_hex() style heat map, added color = “white” to give it a border otherwise it is really unattractive (very dark by default)\n\nggplot(movies, aes(x = year, y = score) ) +\n  geom_hex(color = \"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a scale_fill_gradientn() (your homework part is to figure out how to color a heatmap). I programmed something simple and used the rainbow() function, like rainbow(4) to generate this color scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we remove color= “white” from geom_hex(), we obtain a softer more “watercolor” effect in ggplot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock prices\nFor this stock market graphic, handling the dates correctly is key. So this second graph is more a data management issue. (if the truth be told, data graphics is all about having envisioned a graphic then handling the data to make the graphic real)\nSince there are many dates, use lubridate (part of Tidyverse) and try to maximize the information extracted from the dates. The following code gives us week of the year, day of the week (Monday = 1) and year.\n\nAAPL &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewv/S24STATS101A/main/data/AAPL.csv\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(week = isoweek(Date),\n         wday = wday(Date, week_start = 1),\n         year = year(Date))\n\ngeom_tile() is another good heatmap generator in R. Like geom_hex (or any other graphic) adding color will be key but supplying the basic aes() specification is just as important:\n\nggplot(data= AAPL, aes(x = week, \n                       y = wday, \n                       fill = Close)) +\n  geom_tile()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is where faceting is so useful and using a color to create borders can be helpful especially when presenting information. Still ugly and five times as ugly now… BUT a story is emerging.\n\nggplot(data= AAPL, aes(x = week, \n                       y = wday, \n                       fill = Close)) +\n  geom_tile(color = 'white') +\n  facet_wrap(~ year) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaceting has lots of options. One option is conceptualize the graphic as a kind of storyboard and to use the vertical scrolling (easier) to your advantage. You see vertical scrolling used effectively in news stories or photojournalism. Choosing a single column will also make each graphic wider which will help with the x-axis labels (the wider dimension):\n\nggplot(data= AAPL, aes(x = week, \n                       y = wday, \n                       fill = Close)) +\n  geom_tile(color = 'white') +\n  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 1) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, add a scale_file_gradientn (chose your own colors) to make the graphic more lively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional suggestions, you can always modify theme to help readability:\n\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 6),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"))\n\nYou might even add something like a weekly statistic or a monthly one to your graph within year. You would need to perform some additional data handling though.",

    "text": "Academic Dishonesty\nAs Bruins, we uphold the UCLA Student Code of Conduct. Academic dishonesty means activities like plagiarism, unauthorized material used on exams, unauthorized collaborations etc. According to Senate Regulation A-306, if an instructor encounters a problem, the instructor must report it to the Dean of Students.\n\nhttps://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Student-Conduct#10690514-student-conduct-code\nhttps://ucla.app.box.com/s/8xq1jyrvqhs9343e4rzyvporx9lt8u1g\n\n\nChatGPT policy\nYour instructor’s belief is ChatGPT should be used – wisely – as if it were an amazingly clever tutor or friend. But copying and pasting the code of the first example’s (below) ChatGPT response is not learning and chances are, you won’t remember how to do it if you do not do it regularly. Asking ChatGPT questions in the second way gives your mind the opportunity to develop the skills scaffolding and retain the knowledge long after this course is over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nResponse\n\n\n\n\nPlease write some code in R that splits a dataset into test and training.\nTo split a dataset into training and test sets in R, you commonly use a function like createDataPartition from the caret package:  Using the caret package  First, install and load the caret package if you haven’t already:  install.packages(“caret”)  library(caret)  Next, use the createDataPartition function to create a list of indices for the training set, then use these indices to create the training and test sets:  # Load the necessary package library(caret) # Load or import your dataset (replace ‘your_dataset’ with your actual dataset)  # data &lt;- read.csv(“path/to/your/dataset.csv”)  # Create the data partition  set.seed(123) # Set seed for reproducibility  trainIndex &lt;- createDataPartition(data$your_target_variable, p = .8, list = FALSE, times = 1)  # Create training and test datasets trainData &lt;- data[ trainIndex,] testData &lt;- data[-trainIndex,] Replace your_target_variable with the name of the column that contains the target variable you’re interested in, and replace data with your dataset name.\n\n\nPlease teach me on how to write code using base R that splits a dataset into training and test with a 70-30 split - but don’t write the code for me, I want to learn how to think it through on my own.\nAbsolutely, I’d be glad to guide you on how to approach this!   1. Understanding the Data: - Before you begin, familiarize yourself with the dataset. Use functions like str(), head(), and summary() to understand the structure and contents of your data.  2. Setting a Seed: - To ensure that your results are reproducible, you will want to set a seed using the set.seed() function. This function controls the random number generator in R.  3. Determining the Number of Rows: - You need to know the total number of rows in your dataset to create the splits. The nrow() function can help you determine this.  4. Calculating Split Sizes: - Next, determine how many rows should go into your training and test sets. You’ll want 70% of the data to be in the training set and 30% in the test set. Use arithmetic operations to calculate the respective sizes.  5. Creating a Random Sample of Indices: - To create your training set, you’ll need to randomly select 70% of the indices (row numbers) from your dataset. You can use the sample() function to do this. Remember to use the total number of rows and the size of the training set as parameters in this function.  6. Subsetting the Dataset: - Once you have a vector of random indices, use it to subset your dataset into two parts: one for training and one for testing. In R, you can subset a data frame using square brackets []. You’ll use the vector of random indices to select rows for the training set, and the - operator to select the remaining rows for the test set.  7. Verifying Your Split: - After creating your training and test sets, verify that you’ve split the data correctly. Use the dim() function to check the dimensions of each set and ensure the split ratio is approximately 70-30. You can also use the head() function to quickly view the top rows of each set and ensure they look correct.   Remember to write your code step by step, verifying each part before moving on to the next, to avoid confusion and ensure accuracy. Once you are confident in your understanding of each step, try to write the code on your own. Good luck!\n\n\n\nChatGPT is also a wonderful tool to help you with subjects that are outside of your skill set which do not make sense for you to invest huge amounts of time or resources remembering/learning.",
